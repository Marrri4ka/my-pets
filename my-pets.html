    <p>Welcome to a blog about Ralphie, and Dahlia, two psycho-kitties</p>
    
    <p>This is a list of some of their favorite activities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meowing uncontrollably</li>
      <ul>  
        <li>at 3 am when they can tell you just hit your REM cycle</li>
        <li>at 4:30 am with complimentary headbutts, to make sure you still aren't sleeping too deep</li>
        <li>anytime you walk through the kitchen, because psycho-kitties need constant nourishment to keep up their intensity levels</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sleeping all day until you go to bed</li>
      <li>Getting into the cat nip and derping out</li>
    </ul>
